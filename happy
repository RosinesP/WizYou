HAPPINESS starts with YOU, not with your relationships, no with your job, not with your money, but with YOU.
HAPPINESS is a choice. Choose it everyday.
The most important thing is to ENJOY your LIFE, it's all that matters.
What ever you decide to do, make sure it makes you HAPPY.
TRUE HAPPINESS is to enjoy the PRESENT without anxious dependence upon the FUTURE.
Never let someone steal your HAPPINESS.
To be HAPPY you must be your own SUNSHINE.
Be HAPPY for this moment, this moment is you LIFE.
HAPPINESS is letting go of what you think your LIFE is supposed to look like & CELEBRATING it for everything that it is.
Being HAPPY doesn't mean that everything is PERFECT. It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections.
