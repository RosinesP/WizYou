The best way to predict the future is to invent it
Things work out best for those who make the best of how things work out
To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong
Trust because you are willing to accept the risk, not because it's safe or certain
Eighty percent of success is showing up
You have not failed. You've just found 10,000 ways that won't work
Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm
You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind
Con amor y paciencia, nada es imposible
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going
