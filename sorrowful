Although time wears away many things, something is still missing when a love ends.
Some birds should not be confined. His feathers are too bright ... and when they escape, the part of you that knows it was a sin to have locked them up rejoices, but the part you live with feels empty and sad that he's gone ... I think strange to my friend.
When love ends, something is still missing.
You can love someone very much. But you can never love anyone as much as you can miss them.
That wonder, nostalgia and everything is that, it is a balm. A country is not missed. You miss the neighborhood anyway, but you also miss it if you move 10 blocks away. Anyone who feels like a patriot, whoever thinks they belong to a country is a mental moron. The homeland is an invention. What do I have to do with a Tocumano or a Salte√±o. They are so alien ...
It's weird, right?Nostalgia ... Because having nostalgia in itself is not bad, that is that good things have happened to you and you miss them.For example, I have no nostalgia for anything, because nothing so good has ever happened to me as to be able to miss it ... that is a bitch.Can you be nostalgic for something that hasn't happened to you yet?
Why me ...
It is nostalgia. It is like a drug. It prevents you from seeing things the way they are.
